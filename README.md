# MongoDB
**MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.**
